  - project:
    name: Launch
    details:
      - title: Stats page
        date: April 30, 2018
        content: |
          It is critical to have a stats page that is beautiful and easy to access.

          We will begin by building a lightweight API server that will collect data from the Pigeoncoin blockchain, exchanges,
          and coin listing sites. This server will then transform that data into useful, easy to read, information.

          We've put together a prototype on the **Mining** page. It grabs data from Explorer and CryptoBridge, does some simple math,
          and displays the important bits effortlessly. We like it a lot.

          The graph is static for now, but we'll change that soon!


      - title: Software stack
        date: April 30, 2018
        content: |
          We have many projects lined up, as you can probably tell. It's important to us that we don't waste
          any time, while being prepared for the future. The future includes a bespoke pool system, desktop wallet,
          mobile wallet, and eventually a messaging network.

          We looked far and wide, and tapped into our own experience, as well as consulted with some other professionals
          in software development.

          In the end, we settled on the venerable *MERN stack*.

      - title: Core update
        date: May 14, 2018
        content: |
          We have a very important update to Core wallet that will be released shortly.

          **Security**
          - OpenSSL upgrade
          - Checkpoints
          - TXdata

          **Nitpicks**
          - Copyright date

          We haven't released it yet because we are finishing up our testing. So far so good!

          These small fixes are not easy to see, but they give us all extra peace of mind.
