    - title: Mission
      content: |
        We are using Pigeoncoin, a mineable cryptocurrency, to build a social network which will never have to collect user data to pay the bills.

    - title: Name
      content: |
        Pigeons have been used throughout history to send messages. We're applying the pigeon's legacy to modern communications.

    - title: Get involved
      content: |
        We hang out on Discord, make announcements on Twitter, and can occasionally be found on Telegram. All official social media accounts can be found in our footer.

    - title: Wallet
      content: |
        We release wallets for macOS, Windows, and Linux. These can be found on our front page.

    - title: Mining
      content: |
        Our community has created GPU mining software for Nvidia and AMD GPUs, with software available for Linux and Windows. See our front page for links.

    - title: Exchanges
      content: |
        Our official exchanges are [CryptoBridge](https://crypto-bridge.org/) and [QBTC](https://www.qbtc.com/). You can trade Pigeoncoin (PGN) against Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ravencoin, and CNYT.

    subtitle: The nitty gritty
    topics:

    - title: Consensus
      content: |
         We use the proof-of-work Satoshi blockchain because, quite frankly, it is proven to work. With nine years of battle hardened security, we can rely on it as a source of truth.

    - title: Algorithm
      content: |
        We debuted X16S (shuffle) as an improved version of X16R (random). We improved hashrate and power consistency with no drawbacks. We are proud to have our algorithm listed under the MIT license. We believe that any coin forking away from specific hardware will benefit from using X16S as a wrapper for their existing algorithm. If you are a coin founder with questions about this, please reach out via Discord.

    - title: Difficulty
      content: |
        We debuted the LWMA (linear-weighted moving-average) difficulty algorithm at block 111,222. This algorithm uses the last 45 blocks to calculate the new target, setting a new difficulty each block. This has provided difficulty stability that is simply unmatched by any other method. We recommend the LWMA algorithm to coins of any size.

    - title: Supply
      content: |
        We issue 5000 PGN per block, with a blocktime of one minute, and a halving interval of approximately 4 years. Maximum supply is approximately 21B, of which only <span data-id="chain-supplyPercentage">2%</span> has been issued so far.

    - title: Elevator pitch
      content: |
        We are a software startup that is using our mineable cryptocurrency and our mining pool (wip) to fund a social network called Pigeon. This social network will never need to sell bulk user data, will have an integrated cryptocurrency wallet, and will be designed for the general public.

    - title: Innovation
      content: |
        We are using cryptocurrencies to create a new funding mechanism for a social network. We are designing a Pigeoncoin mining pool for mass adoption so that the fee can be used to fund all of the operating costs of the social network. Mining with our pool is a no-brainer because the value will be directly affected by the amount of revenue that the pool generates. Pigeoncoin will be tradable on the Pigeon social network.

    - title: Invest
      content: |
        You can obtain Pigeoncoin by mining with a graphics card or trading on one of our verified exchanges.

        If you are an accredited investor and have a specific request, please reach out to the team via Discord.
